not HTTP. When executed with the only argument it dumps
the state of the specified device. If three or five arguments are specified, it
changes the state of the device and dumps the new state.

.SH EXAMPLES
Suppose a user has two EG-PMS-LAN devices configured as follows:
.IP
1. 192.168.0.10, port 5000, password hackme
.br
2. 192.168.10.10, port 5001, password hackmesoftly
.LP
In order to control them using the utility the user needs to create a
configuration file like the following:
.IP
eg1 pms20 192.168.0.10  5000 hackme
.br
eg2 pms20 192.168.10.10 5001 hackmesoftly
.LP
Now she can get the status of the devices with commands
.IP
.B egctl eg1
.br
.B egctl eg2
.LP
and switch the state of the AC power sockets with a command like
.IP
.B egctl eg1 on left left off
.LP
or with simplified combined option
.IP
.B egctl eg1 1**0
.LP
.SH FILES
